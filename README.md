- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaumeGreen
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, rpgs, games, books, swing dancing, ... nothing out of the usual
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I can, sometimes too many things at the same time (J, C# 6 + maui, F#, ...)
- 💞️ I’m maybe looking to collaborate on maui for linux, or other things that might interest me.
- 📫 How to reach me : at this username in gmail.
